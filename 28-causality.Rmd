How come everyone in the past did not know what every kid knows these days: that cigarettes are bad for you.
The reason is the difficulty in causal inference. 
Scientists knew about the correlations between smoking and disease, but no one could prove one caused the other. These could have been nothing more than correlations, with some external cause. 

Cigarettes were declared dangerous without any direct causal evidence. 
It was in the USA's [surgeon general report of 1964](https://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/ps/retrieve/Narrative/NN/p-nid/60) that it was decided that despite of the impossibility of showing a direct causal relation, the circumstantial evidence is just too strong, and declared cigarettes as dangerous.
